# hello-world
just another repository

I am sort of novice, when it comes to python. I learning how to refine my skills in programming/coding because of my interest in game development. Its sort of something to do with my time; really looking forward to bring my ideas to life. Haven't decided whether going to school for this kind of thing is worth it, just yet. Till then, plan to have fun and create some games for my friends and myself.
